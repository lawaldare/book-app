The books are given in first come first serve, however, when a teacher is requesting for the same book a student is asking for, the teacher comes first, When a junior student is asking for the same book a senior student is asking for, the senior student comes first.

Prototype Methods
At Minimum
The Teacher and the student should be prototyped into the person data type classes, No functions should be declared outside the prototyping of the classes.
All tests must test all methods, including the conditionals that they may contain (Arguments are customized in the tests, so all conditions in the method get tested)
Repeated activities are put into functions and referenced from there
Exceed Specifications
All the functions are implemented with Inheritance.
The codebase is efficient, not redundant loops or method calls that could deter performance.
All Repeated activities are put into functions and referenced from there
