Book Library 

Requirements
Fellows are required to have completed the following Outcomes: 1 - 4

Problem Description
A book Library where a student, teacher borrows books. When the copy of the book is no longer in the library. The library should return ‘book taken’. They can be multiple copies of the same book in the library. The books are given in first come first serve, however, when a teacher is requesting for the same book a student is asking for, the teacher comes first, When a junior student is asking for the same book a senior student is asking for, the senior student comes first.


How will I complete this project?
Use ES5/ES6 consistently throughout the project 
Organise the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests
Write tests to cover all the methods to be written, before development begins (TDD) 
All the tests should fail, hopefully, for all the methods below
Test acceptance is 97% coverage.



Steps to evaluate the Checkpoint one
Prototype Methods
At Minimum
The Teacher and the student should be prototyped into the person data type classes, No functions should be declared outside the prototyping of the classes.
All tests must test all methods, including the conditionals that they may contain (Arguments are customized in the tests, so all conditions in the method get tested)
Repeated activities are put into functions and referenced from there
Exceed Specifications
All the functions are implemented with Inheritance.
The codebase is efficient, not redundant loops or method calls that could deter performance.
All Repeated activities are put into functions and referenced from there

Test Coverage
At Minimum
All the prototyped methods are to be covered fully with tests
The tests should cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employed
All the comparators used for the tests must be the optimum or most efficient comparator for the scenario
